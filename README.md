# 3DOpenGLScene

A new design skill my work on this project helped me to craft is the ability to create scenes using just OpenGL. Before this project, I did not know how to do these things like creating shapes, applying textures, or making animations with OpenGL. The design process I followed for my project work was to review other examples of similar work and apply what I had learned to my own project incrementally. Tactics from my design approach will be applied in my future work, since this is how I tackle many projects, by observing others like it and building off of those. 

A new development strategy I used while working on my 3D scene ties in with my design skills, which allowed me to create this 3D scene. Iteration factored into my development since each week created an addition to the previous edition of the scene. My approach to developing code has evolved throughout these milestones, leading to the project's completion, by reinforcing my ability to build on top of previous versions of my code. Computational graphcis and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills of math and 3D graphics that I can apply in my future educational pathway if I ever have to create more 3D scenes or implement useful pieces of code I have gained from this course into other projects.
